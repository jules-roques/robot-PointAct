PointAct is a 3D-aware vision-language-action policy for robot manipulation. It keeps a pretrained vision-language backbone for semantic understanding and adds a dedicated point-action expert so that multi-scale 3D geometry can directly shape action decoding.

## Installation

Please follow the main setup guide in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md). The recommended workflow is:

1. Create the core `pointact` environment for training, checkpoint loading, preprocessing, and the policy server.
2. Create separate simulator environments.
3. Use the server-client evaluation pipeline since the policy and simulator usually need different environments.

## Supported Benchmarks

This repository currently supports three simulators:

| Benchmark | Simulator | Experiment Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [LIBERO](experiments/2_libero/README.md) | [LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO) | [`experiments/2_libero`](experiments/2_libero) |
| [RLBench](experiments/10_rlbench/README.md) | [RLBench](https://github.com/stepjam/RLBench) | [`experiments/10_rlbench`](experiments/10_rlbench) |
| [RoboCASA365](docs/robocasa365.md) | [RoboCASA](https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa) | [`experiments/13_robocasa365`](experiments/13_robocasa365) |

For RoboCASA365, [`docs/robocasa365.md`](docs/robocasa365.md) is an end-to-end guide covering
environment setup, asset and dataset downloads, dataset construction, training and evaluation.
